                    <p>My name is Casey Lee. 
                        I grew up playing basketball, video games, and music. 
                        If you guessed that as an adult, I would like to play NBA 2K on Playstation while listening to music, you'd be correct. 
                        That does sounds like a fun night-in for me!</p>
                    <p>I've created this website to be my portolio as part of a coding bootcamp. 
                        As this class goes on, I'm planning on updating this portfolio to show-off what I've learned. 
                        My goal for this portfolio will be to display my capabilities as a front-end developer. 
                        I hope you're as excited as I am to see what this portfolio will look like at the end of the boot camp!
                        Thank you for visiting. </p>
